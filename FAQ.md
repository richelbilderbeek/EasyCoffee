[EasyCoffee](README.md) FAQ.

## How can it be that the EasyCoffee way tastes at least just as good as the coffee created from expensive coffee beans by expensive complicated machines?

Because objectively it is! 

It is well known that the more resources (time, money, etc.) we invest in something (e.g making coffee) the more likely it is we believe we created something better. It is called the placebo effect. Additionally, there might be cultural effects. This is called coffee snobism. 

Shake off those old habits and enjoy the EasyCoffee way!

## Do you consider yourself a professional barista?

Yes, because I know everything about coffee that is important to know.

## I am or want to become a professional barista, can you teach me?

Yes, I teach my technique to everyone that wants to master it. When I have time and you can get my expenses covered, I do it for free. A full training session lasts about five minutes and you will get a certificate.

## Which brand of instant coffee do you recommend?

The cheapest. At my supermarket, this happens to be Paco instant coffee.

## What's in it for you financially?

Nothing. I have not a single relation to any company related to coffee whatsoever.
