# FAQ

[EasyCoffee](README.md) FAQ.

## Do you consider yourself a professional barista?

Yes, because I know everything about coffee that is important to know.

## I am or want to become a professional barista, can you teach me?

Yes, I teach my technique to everyone that wants to master it. When I have time and you can get my expenses covered, I do it for free. A full training session lasts about five minutes and you will get a certificate.
