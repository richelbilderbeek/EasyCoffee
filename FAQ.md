## What is EasyCoffee?

[EasyCoffee](README.md) is a guide to make excellent coffee in one minute without using specialized machines.

## What are the benefits of EasyCoffee?

 * Excellent coffee
 * No investment in expensive machines needed
 * Cheap coffee, estimated cost per big cup: couple of USD/euro cents
 * Time saving
 * Emotional satisfaction: no placebo effect and/or coffee snobism
 * Probably a smaller carbon footprint

## How can it be that the EasyCoffee way tastes at least just as good as the coffee created from expensive coffee beans by expensive complicated machines?

Because objectively it is! 

It is well known that the more resources (time, money, etc.) we invest in something (e.g making coffee) the more likely it is we believe we created something better. It is called the placebo effect. Additionally, there might be cultural effects. This is called coffee snobism. 

Shake off those old habits and enjoy the EasyCoffee way!

## Do you consider yourself a professional barista?

Yes, because I know everything about coffee that is important to know.

## I am or want to become a professional barista, can you teach me?

Yes, I teach my technique to everyone that wants to master it. When I have time and you can get my expenses covered, I do it for free. A full training session lasts about five minutes and you will get a certificate.

## Which brand of instant coffee do you recommend?

The cheapest. At my supermarket, this happens to be Paco instant coffee.

## What's in it for you financially?

Nothing. I have not a single relation to any company related to coffee whatsoever.

## Is it important to clean the sink?

No, it is not important to clean the sink.

## Is it important to clean the tap?

No, it is not important to clean the tap.

## Is it important to clean the outside of the cup?

No, it is not important to clean the outside of the cup.

## I have no cutlery to stir the partially dissolved coffee powder. How to make EasyCoffee anyway?

You have two options:
 * Make the suspension mix by shaking the cup with suspension in a horizontal circular motion (clockwise works as good as counter-clockwise). Take care not to shake too hard, otherwise some delecious coffee may spill out of the cup
 * Find something else to stir with. The rules for this are very complex, so either don't do this or ask an expert

## I have no cup to hold the coffee. How to make EasyCoffee anyway?

YOU CANNOT USE YOUR MOUTH AS A CONTAINER! The hot water from the tap will burn your mouth! However, if you use cold water instead, you can make a delicious cold EasyCoffee (especially good in Summer)!

You can use most other containers. You could even use the kitchen sink as a sink (you might want to clean it first) and use a straw to drink the Easy Coffee.

## I have no access to a kitchen sink tap to get hot water. How to make EasyCoffee anyway?

You can get hot water from a shower or tap in the bathroom.

A time-intensive alternative is to find cold water and boil it. Cold water can be found in bottles, most taps and in the toilet (Tip: use the water in the water tank, instead of the water in the bottom of the toilet). Boiling the water is even more complex: you can use a microwave, oven, kitchen stove (both gas and electrical), water boiler and many more ways. If in doubt: don't do it or ask an expert.

## I have no instant coffee. How to make EasyCoffee anyway?

You cannot: it is the instant coffee that is the only vital ingredient for EasyCoffee.

You can create (non-Easy) coffee if you have coffee beans, or grinded coffee beans, but it is needlessly much work and I won't describe the whole lengthy process here.
